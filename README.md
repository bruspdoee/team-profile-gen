# Team Profile Generator 

* This is a Node.js command line application that prompts the user with questions to build a profile for their Team in an HTML file.

* It will first start with the Manager of the team and ask questions like "What is your name, number, email, etc" then it will ask if they would like to add on a team member (Either and Engineer or an Intern OR if you're a one man crew - it will give you an option to finish it off)

* If Engineer is selected, you will be prompted with questions to create a profile for the Engineers(s) on your team. 

* Same goes for Intern 

* Then, once you select "No more team members" options, it will end the CLI and create a team.html file with cards for each team member starting with the Manager. 

* Create a profile for your team, and check this app out!
